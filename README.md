## Cuantas Sabes / How many you know
In my first semester of biomedical engineering at ECI 'Julio Garavito', I must develop a project which solves a problem in the medical world, due to my previous knowledge in android development I decided to build this app 'How Many you know.'

Is an app to help speech therapist with the semantic awareness and interpretation of the world things in children with less than 12 years old.

All the images were reviewed and provided by a speech therapist specialized in children.

## Project Overview
In this project the user can register as a doctor who will provide the app to their patients, so the user can register as a patient too.
The doctor will be able to:
-   get information about their patients
-   get information about the quizes realized by their patients to support their diagnosis.

## How I did it?
This project was built in Java and XML. I used so many libraries to give an easy way to pick things and fill the formulary.

Firebase often is the best way, with firebase I used the firebase Auth (Google, Email, and Facebook) Firebase Database and Firebase Storage to keep all the images needed for the practice of everyone based on their age.
The easiest way to get the children voice was with the Google API, probably out there are better ways, but taking into account time and money, it was the best option.
